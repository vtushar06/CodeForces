Note
In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a 100
dollar bill, a 20
dollar bill, and a 5
dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive 125
dollars in one or two bills.

In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two 20
dollar bills and three 1
dollar bills.

In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw 100000000
(ten million!) 100
dollar bills.
