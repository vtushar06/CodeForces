A. Fashionable Array
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
In 2077, everything became fashionable among robots, even arrays...

We will call an array of integers 𝑎
fashionable if min(𝑎)+max(𝑎)
is divisible by 2
without a remainder, where min(𝑎)
— the value of the minimum element of the array 𝑎
, and max(𝑎)
— the value of the maximum element of the array 𝑎
.

You are given an array of integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
. In one operation, you can remove any element from this array. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the array 𝑎
fashionable.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡
(1≤𝑡≤103
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer 𝑛
(1≤𝑛≤50
) — the size of the array 𝑎
.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛
integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
(1≤𝑎𝑖≤50
) — the elements of the array 𝑎
.

Output
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the array 𝑎
fashionable.

Note
In the first test case, at least one element needs to be removed since min(𝑎)+max(𝑎)=2+5=7
, and 7
is not divisible by 2
. If any of the elements are removed, only one element will remain. Then max(𝑎)+min(𝑎)
will be divisible by 2
.

In the second test case, nothing needs to be removed since min(𝑎)+max(𝑎)=1+9=10
, and 10
is divisible by 2
.

In the third test case, you can remove the elements with values 2
and 4
, then min(𝑎)+max(𝑎)=5+11=16
, and 16
is divisible by 2
.
