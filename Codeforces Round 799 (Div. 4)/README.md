time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given four distinct integers 𝑎
, 𝑏
, 𝑐
, 𝑑
.

Timur and three other people are running a marathon. The value 𝑎
is the distance that Timur has run and 𝑏
, 𝑐
, 𝑑
correspond to the distances the other three participants ran.

Output the number of participants in front of Timur.

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡
(1≤𝑡≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The description of each test case consists of four distinct integers 𝑎
, 𝑏
, 𝑐
, 𝑑
(0≤𝑎,𝑏,𝑐,𝑑≤104
).

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of participants in front of Timur.

Note
For the first test case, there are 2
people in front of Timur, specifically the participants who ran distances of 3
and 4
. The other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter distance than Timur.

For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur, since he ran a distance of 10000
while all others ran a distance of 0
, 1
, and 2
respectively.

For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of 600
while Timur ran a distance of 500
.
