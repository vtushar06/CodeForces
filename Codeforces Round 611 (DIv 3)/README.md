Codeforces separates its users into 4
divisions by their rating:

For Division 1: 1900≤rating
For Division 2: 1600≤rating≤1899
For Division 3: 1400≤rating≤1599
For Division 4: rating≤1399
Given a rating
, print in which division the rating
belongs.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑡
(1≤𝑡≤104
) — the number of testcases.

The description of each test consists of one line containing one integer rating
(−5000≤rating≤5000
).

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the correct division in the format "Division X", where 𝑋
is an integer between 1
and 4
representing the division for the corresponding rating.

Note
For test cases 1−4
, the corresponding ratings are −789
, 1299
, 1300
, 1399
, so all of them are in division 4
.

For the fifth test case, the corresponding rating is 1400
, so it is in division 3
.

For the sixth test case, the corresponding rating is 1679
, so it is in division 2
.

For the seventh test case, the corresponding rating is 2300
, so it is in division 1
.
